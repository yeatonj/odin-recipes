            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a quick and easy fried rice dish. I recommend you use a rice cooker to prepare the rice, but you're welcome to just follow the directions on the rice packaging to do so on the stove if you so choose. You'll want a wok for this recipe; make sure you're cooking everything on high heat!</p>
            <p>Many fried rice recipes recommend you cook the rice beforehand and chill it overnight, but I haven't found that completely necessary... Your mileage may vary!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Approximately 1 pound green beans, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
                <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
                <li>2-3 Thai chilis, diced into small pieces</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce or oyster sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>Coarsely ground pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the wok over high heat and add oil. Pour in the eggs and cook for 20-30 seconds, then flip and cook for another 20-30 seconds. Eggs should be a little soft in the middle but crispy around the edges. Remove into a bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the green beans and cook over high heat. Stir constantly; after 2-3 minutes they should be well softened with some charring. Remove them into the same bowl.</li>
                <li>Add oil to the wok again. Add the rice and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring as often as possible.</li>
                <li>Move rice to the sides and add chilis and garlic. Cook for 20 seconds or so, then mix into rice.</li>
                <li>Add the green beans and eggs back to the wok. Break up egg and mix well, cooking for another 30-60 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add the fish/oyster sauce and soy sauce and mix well. Add freshly ground pepper to taste, then serve in bowls.</li>
            </ol>
