            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These are my favorite cookies, a loose adaption on a recipe from the Williams Sonoma book <em>Baking</em>. They are a fairly standard ginger molasses cookie with two great characteristics for someone lazy like me: they are easy to make, and they are very tasty! I try to let them chill for longer than the specified one hour and also like to underbake them a little bit, but if you like them a little more crispy you should leave them in the oven for longer.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
                <li>1.5 teaspoons ground cinanamon</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
                <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1/4 cup molasses</li>
                <li>Granulated sugar</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

                <li>Refrigerate, covered, for at least 2 hours.</li>
